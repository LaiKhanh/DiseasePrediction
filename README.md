The major purpose of this project is to develop an application for patients and doctors to predict disease based on their descriptions of the symptoms and body conditions.

The primary objectives of the project include:
-	User-centric interface: Creating a user-friendly and easy-to-use website for users to describe their symptoms and receive results. This guarantees that the procedure can be used by people with different levels of technical expertise.
-	Symptom analysis: Developing a robust model capable of analyzing and detecting specific symptoms based on textual data provided by users.
-	Disease prediction: Implementing a predictive model that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict disease from the identified symptoms.
-	Information dissemination: Providing both patients and healthcare professionals with detailed information related to the predicted disease, including a list of symptoms, disease description, recommended medications,â€¦

Limitation
-	Data quality dependency: The accuracy and reliability of the employed models depend on the quality and diversity of the dataset used for training.
-	The training models may not cover all possible illnesses or range of symptoms. This may limit how broadly they can be applied in real-world situations.

Continuous Improvement: Our system is designed for continuous improvement. As we gather more data, the machine learning models evolve, providing increasingly accurate and relevant recommendations.
